# TODO: Write a short (1-3 paragraph) design document about your solution to Q4.
#       Please include the following:
#     
#         1) An explanation of what you wrote and how the ScriptPubKey works
#         2) Briefly, how the ScriptPubKey you wrote fits into the bigger 
#            picture of this atomic swap.
#         3) Consider the case of Alice sending coins to Bob with coinExchangeScript:
#            Why can Alice always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it? 
#            Why can't this be solved with a simple 1-of-2 multisig? 
#

1. The ScriptPK runs a if/else statement -- if the last value in the ScriptSig is true
   (equal to 1), then it assumes that the recipient knows the secret key and runs a script
   to ensure that the hash of the secret key matches the provided hash and that the recipient
   signed the transaction. If the last value of the ScriptSig is false, then it assumes that the
   sender is trying to retrieve their money and checks for signatures from both the sender and 
   recipient. As long as the sender and recipient know the correct formats for their ScriptSigs,
   then they can retrieve or redeem their money appropriately.

2. In addition to the ScriptPK I created, other transactions are created with locktimes that allow
   the original senders to retrieve their money in the event that the recipient doesn't take it.
   For example, if both Alice and Bob create transactions using my ScriptPK and then Alice never
   sends Bob the secret x, then Bob has a backup transaction that allows him to retrieve from the
   same transaction hash assuming that the locktime has passed.

3. Alice can always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it because she will have retrieved Bob's
   signature in advance -- in the event that Bob doesn't retrieve the money, she has Bob's signature and
   can redeem her money by spending from the additional transaction she made that has a locktime. A
   simple 1-of-2 multisig would not work because that would allow either Bob or Alice to retrieve the
   funds at any time.
